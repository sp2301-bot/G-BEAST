Geofencing based Employee Attendane System

In any organization employee management is a lengthy and hectic task and a lot of resources are required to manage
it . Attendance based systems exist but there are a lot of constraints present in it .Admin has to make sure that
employees come to the office in the designated time. In todayâ€™s world, work is done in different environments.
Different employees are placed in different sectors. So this adds a burden on the admin to track employees and
hence this reduces the efficiency of employees. The Employee Tracking App is an app that is designed to track the
attendance of the employee by using GPS and Geofencing. The system engineer sets the fence around which
attendance will be accepted. The employee gives the attendance being in the geofence and if the employee goes out
of the fence then he/she won't be allowed to mark their attendance.
